Variables:

Array: word //this would work as a character array since the game will be checking it to the characters that are guessed
//game needs some kind of database to choose words from

Int: wordLength

Array: lettersGuessed (array with 26 bools, 1 if already guessed, 0 if not guessed)
	//this way, you can compare the ascii value of the input character to the index in the array
	to see if it's been guessed already

Int: wrongGuessesLeft

Game:
Game picks a random word and displays underscores "_ _ _ _" for how many letters the word has
Output: "Guess a letter or guess the whole word"
After player input,
If letter is correct, "You got one, guess again!"
If letter is incorrect, "Wrong, try again!"

Displays word again with all of the guessed letters filled in "_ A _ A _ A"
Outputs the letters that the player has guessed
Outputs the number of wrong guesses they can still make

If word is correct or player guesses the last correct letter,
"You win! The word was BANANA! press R to play again"

Since this game will be using socket programming, the input and output will be replaced with send and receive for the client and host.
