Pseudocode for Hangman Client:


Int variable to hold maximum number of wrong guesses
Create the socket
Create the structs that I will need to use for connection to the server
Connect the socket to the server using the structs
While loop to keep playing the game if client inputs ‘R’
        Set maximum number of wrong guesses to 0 for new game
Start infinite while loop to play the game while numberOfWrongGuesses <= maximum variable
        Client inputs a guess letter for the word
        If the letter has already been guessed break to allow the user to guess again
Else If the letter is in the word break back into the while loop and allow the client to guess again.
Else the letter is not in the word and the numberOfGuesses will be incremented by 1
After the client has either won or lost the game they can choose to play again with ‘R’
        If the client responds with ‘R’, then the game will restart with a different word
        Else client will exit the while loop
Client will close the connection
