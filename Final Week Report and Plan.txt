Report on Progress thus far:

Server and Client code in C has been coming along nicely and teh hangman code with database application has been
prototyped with implementation coming in the next week. Overall, progress has been steady and we feel we are on track to 
finish on time.

Plan for the Final Week:

We expect to be able to begin complete testing by the end of this week where our project will be near a working form. 
The client and server codes are operation and the hangman game is close to correct. This weeks plan is to put the 
two codebases (connection and game) together in order to move to the final stage of this project. In the final stage, we will
test and debug the final product in order to be prepared for presentations in the coming week.
